    <h1> Hi! I'm Claire:</h1>

    <main>
    <p>Iâ€™m currently an undergrad student at the University of Michigan. I live in New York and was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. <br>
      <br> <!-- New line --> 
      Iâ€™ve always loved traditional art, but have expanded my passion towards technology based design. Studying interactions between users and their screens has become a great interest to me, and learning to apply the design theories and illustration techniques Iâ€™ve previously learned to user interaction has been really eye-opening. It allows me to be hands on in all stages of app designing process from creating screens to illustrating them to prototyping them!<br>
      <br> <!-- New line -->    
      Expanding my interests is one of the most important things to me, and Iâ€™m forever searching to learn new forms to express myself through. I often explore my creative pursuits through experimenting with a vast variety of different aspects of art and design.
